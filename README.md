# Fedi Alpha

Fedi Alpha, powered by Fedimint. 

Fedimint is a modular open source protocol to custody and transact bitcoin in a community context, built on a strong foundation of privacy. 

Fedi, is the worlds first Federated OS. 

Toegther they allow communities to deploy Federations to manage their money, data and online lives, taking back control.

Federations are made up of a set of fedimint servers run by independent guardians that collaborate to form a federation. Here we have a custom build of Fedimint that will help you setup your own federations and connect using Fedi Alpha.

> Please be advised - Fedi Alpha is an early Alpha release of Fedimint and Fedi, which is intended for use by builders, developers and enthusiasts. 
>
>This is intended solely for testing purposes.
>
> We strongly advise against using this version of the app for any significant financial transactions as there is a risk of loss. It is important to note that Fedi assumes no responsibility for any loss or use of the test version of the app and web app.

## Get Building

Here are some things to help get started!

1. **Try out the Fedi app**: Head to [alpha.fedi.xyz](https://alpha.fedi.xyz) to download the app and get set up.
2. **Run your own Federation:** Stand up your own federation for long run testing in your community.
3. **Develop your own sites and modules:** Setup your developer environment and jump into the Fedimint developer community.

* Please be careful of using a fedimint on mainnet. Whilst this is possible the software is in an alpha state and there is a real possibility of lost funds. 

### 1. Try out the Fedi app

The simplest way to understand a fedimint is to use it!

It's important that Federations should be broadly distributed around the world, we hope one day to see millions of Federations deployed in communities across the planet by people like you. 

To get going quickly though, we've deployed a Federation on a public signet - MutinyNet, that will allow you to experiment with the app and features.

Head to [alpha.fedi.xyz](https://alpha.fedi.xyz) to get started.

### 2. Run your own Federation

Once you've had a look around the app, you may decide you want to try this out yourself.

Head to the [Fedimint github repo](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint) to familiarize yourself with the project and then jump onto [the Fedimint Discord](https://discord.gg/Nz6jUj4q), where you'll find us supporting deployment parties over the next month where weâ€™ll we'll help you through the setup using the [official docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/fedimint). 

Coming soon Fedi is working with several partners to bring 1-click installs to enthusiasts around the world.

### 3. Develop your own sites and modules

The Fedi app is designed to be extensible and interoperable with the best of Bitcoin. 

We use open standards to allow you to write your own applications that work with the Fedi app. 

Accounts are managed from your key (via LNURL-Auth), restore your wallet and restore access to every site you have an account on. 

Need to send or withdraw to the wallet, just use simple WebLN integration to move money to your favorite sites.

More than this, Fedimint is a modular open source protocol. 

You can write any consensus application or any smart contract you want in Rust and run it right there in the fedimint. Simple, Scalable and Safe. 

Check out some examples from the [Fedi and Epoch VC hackathon from January 2023](https://www.fedi.xyz/blog/fedimint-hackaton-winners).

To get started with development you can launch a ready to go developer environment on clovyr.

As always though, if you'd prefer to get into the details, please join us on [the Fedimint Discord](https://discord.gg/Nz6jUj4q) to learn more about setting up your developer environment through Nix or head to the [introduction for contributors](https://github.com/fedibtc/fedimint-fedi/blob/master/docs/contributing.md)

We'll also be running a series of webinars, workshops and tutorials which we'll be sharing through the website [fedi.xyz/builders](https://fedi.xyz/builders).
